Introduction
Emotion detection from facial expressions can be useful in various applications such as human-computer interaction, security, and entertainment. This project leverages a pre-trained neural network model to classify emotions from video input.

Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection.git
cd emotion-detection
Install the required libraries:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the Emotion_Detection.h5 file in the project directory.

Usage
Ensure the required files (Emotion_Detection.h5 and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) are in the project directory.
Run the video tester script:
sh
Copy code
python rdvideotester.py
The script will capture video input from your webcam, detect faces, and classify emotions using the pre-trained model.
